# International Association of Intellectual Games
## Who are we?

We, players of competitive versions of ["What? Where? When?" (ЧГК)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%3F_Where%3F_When%3F#Competitive_game), "Brain-Ring", [Jeopardy!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!) (its [sport modification](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%8F_%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0#%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F)), and other similar intellectual games, have joined forces to create an organization of enthusiasts. An organization built on principles of openness and equality; an organization that will support the intellectual games movement.

## What are the games?

The intellectual games nurture critical thinking through questions covering a wide range of topics such as history, science, art, etc. This exposure enhances not only the knowledge but also the curiosity to explore and learn more about various subjects.

The games bring together people from different backgrounds to compete on an equal footing, fostering a sense of camaraderie and sportsmanship. This shared experience strengthens social bonds while promoting respect for diverse opinions and perspectives.
## What do we want?

The IAIG aims to promote intellectual activities that foster critical thinking, knowledge sharing, and social cohesion in Europe and worldwide. To ensure fair competition, the IAIG develops common rules for mind sports such as team quizzes and Jeopardy-style games. It also maintains the infrastructure to compute team ratings.

Currently, most of the games are played in Russian, but the IAIG plans to promote games in other languages such as Ukrainian, Belarusian, Kazakh, and English.
